
Pandas Challenge
Need to complete **one of two** (not both)

Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**. Done 
2. Clone the new repository to your computer. Done
3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **HeroesOfPymoli** or **PyCitySchools**. I chose PyCitySchools.
4. Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis. Done 
5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab. Done


Option 2: PyCitySchools

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
You'll be given access to every student's math and reading score
as well as various information on the schools they attend
Aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Your final report should include each of the following:

District Summary
Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score	
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

School Summary
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)


Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing
School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

Math Scores by Grade
Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. 
Include in the table each of the following:
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

Scores by School Size
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

Scores by School Type
Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:
Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook. Done

Submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook. Done

Include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data. See School_Challenge-checkpoint.ipynb
Use Example Solution for a reference on expected format.


Hints and Considerations

Learning to program requires one to constantly tinker, experiment, and learn on the fly. You are doing exactly the _right_ thing, if you find yourself constantly practicing Google-Fu and diving into documentation. There is just no way (or reason) to try and memorize it all. 
Online references are available for you to use when you need them. So use them! Take each of these tasks one at a time. Begin your work, answering the basic questions:
"How do I import the data?" 
"How do I convert the data into a DataFrame?" 
"How do I build the first table?" 

Don't get intimidated by the number of asks. Many of them are repetitive in nature with just a few tweaks. Be persistent and creative!Expect these exercises to take time! Don't get discouraged if you find yourself spending hours initially with little progress. Force yourself to deal with the discomfort of not knowing and forge ahead. Consider these hours an investment in your future! As always, feel encouraged to work in groups and get help from your TAs and Instructor. Just remember, true success comes from mastery and _not_ a completed homework assignment. So challenge yourself to truly succeed! Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
