Need to complete **one of two** (not both)

Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **HeroesOfPymoli** or  **PyCitySchools**.
4. Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.
5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli
Final report should include each of the following:
* Player Count
* Total Number of Players
* Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue
Gender Demographics
* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed
Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* The below each broken by gender
* Purchase Count
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender
Age Demographics
* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)
* Purchase Count
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group
Purchasing Analysis (age)
* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)
* Purchase Count
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Average Purchase Total per Person by Age
* Top Spenders
Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
* SN
* Purchase Count
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Purchase Value
* Most Popular Items
Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
o Item ID
o Item Name
o Purchase Count
o Item Price
o Total Purchase Value
o Most Profitable Items
Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
o Item ID
o Item Name
o Purchase Count
o Item Price
o Total Purchase Value

As final considerations: 
* Use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
* Include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Use Example Solution for a reference on expected format.

Hints and Considerations
* Learning to program requires one to constantly tinker, experiment, and learn on the fly.
* You are doing exactly the _right_ thing, if you find yourself constantly practicing Google-Fu and diving into documentation.
* There is just no way (or reason) to try and memorize it all. 
* Online references are available for you to use when you need them. So use them!
* Take each of these tasks one at a time. 
* Begin your work, answering the basic questions:
* "How do I import the data?" 
* "How do I convert the data into a DataFrame?" 
* "How do I build the first table?" 
* Don't get intimidated by the number of asks. Many of them are repetitive in nature with just a few tweaks. 
* Be persistent and creative!
* Expect these exercises to take time! 
* Don't get discouraged if you find yourself spending  hours initially with little progress. 
* Force yourself to deal with the discomfort of not knowing and forge ahead. 
* Consider these hours an investment in your future!
* As always, feel encouraged to work in groups and get help from your TAs and Instructor. 
* Just remember, true success comes from mastery and _not_ a completed homework assignment. So challenge yourself to truly succeed!
* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file


Rubric
Instructions:

Evaluate the homework against the outlined criteria in the below rubric, assigning a rating to each criterion. Add points earned across all criteria and convert the total points to a letter grade, assigning a “+” or “-” letter grade designation at your discretion.
A (+/-)90+C (+/-)40-64F (+/-)<15B (+/-)65-89D (+/-)15-39Notes:
The deployed assignment utilizes the Pandas library to analyze 1 of 2 challenges. Only one assignment will be accepted for grading. The source code should also be deployed to Github or Gitlab.
